    The AbstractDirectedGraph class is the basic interface one needs to implement for providing
    a backend storage of the data. It is complementary to the AbstractNode interface.

    You only need to provide the implementation for this interface, and then an ObjectGraph can
    be automatically built upon it.

    The methods you need to implement fall into the following categories:
     - create / delete node(s)
     - get all nodes / only nodes from a given class
     - check whether a node lives in a given graph
     - find a node given a list of matching properties
